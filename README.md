My Bachelor's thesis where I implemented a pipeline for genetically training a neural network agent which controls a rocket in a 2D simulation whose goal is to collect points. The entire project is implemented in Java with a support of the dyn4j physics engine.

An implementation of a genetic algorithm for optimizing the schedule of working sundays to maximize seller profit and citizen satisfaction. The algorithm, data extraction and visualizations are all implemented in Python.

A group project where we implemented a pipeline for genetically tranining agents (both Neural network and Cartesian genetic product) which play a PvP game in a top down 2D environment. The game and the simulator were implemented in Java using Processing whereas the genetic algorithm was implemented in Python. This lead to a very interesting Python-Java communication infrastructure.

An optimization challenge in the context of CMC-FER-2024 Competition where we had to optimize the layout of mirrors and the light source to optimally light up the room. For the purposes of the task, we implemented a completely generic framework for genetic optimization in Java and using a combination of nature expired optimization algorithms we got an algorithm that consistently found solutions which got us the 5th place score at the competition.

An optimization challenge in the context of CMC-FER-2025 Competition where we had to optimize the layout of pieces to cover the holes in a way that minimizes travel time and circumfrance of the pieces. For this purpose, we implemented a genetic algorithm using the previously mentioned generic framework for a part of the task. We also used simulated annealing for solving a small TSP and other algorithmic components for solving this complicated task. In the end our scored secured us the 2nd place.

Full-Stack passion project where I implemented a full stack, interactive quiz app based in a chat environment. I used Flask for backend, PostgreSQL for database and a React frontend. To round it all up I acquired my own domain and a VPS to host my page and deployed it using Docker and nginx.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/jetpans/portfolio/blob/master/Images/ConnectiNET.png"> **[ConnectiNET](https://github.com/jetpans/ConnectiNET-kraljevi)**

Full-Stack web team project in the context of university where we developed a page for promoting and rating events. Technologies which we used are
Flask(Python), PostgreSQL, Firebase and React. I mostly contributed working on backend-database infrastructure and implemented a few full-stack features.
