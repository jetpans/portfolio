Full-Stack web team project in the context of university where we developed a page for promoting and rating events. Technologies which we used are
Flask(Python), PostgreSQL, Firebase and React. I mostly contributed working on backend-database infrastructure and implemented a few full-stack features.

My Bachelor's thesis where I implemented a pipeline for genetically training a neural network agent which controls a rocket in a 2D simulation whose goal is to collect points. The entire project is implemented in Java with a support of the dyn4j physics engine.

An implementation of a genetic algorithm for optimizing the schedule of working sundays to maximize seller profit and citizen satisfaction. The algorithm, data extraction and visualizations are all implemented in Python.

A group project where we implemented a pipeline for genetically tranining agents (both Neural network and Cartesian genetic product) which play a PvP game in a top down 2D environment. The game and the simulator were implemented in Java using Processing whereas the genetic algorithm was implemented in Python. This lead to a very interesting Python-Java communication infrastructure.

An optimization challenge in the context of CMC-FER-2024 Competition where we had to optimize the layout of mirrors and the light source to optimally light up the room. For the purposes of the task, we implemented a completely generic framework for genetic optimization in Java and using a combination of nature expired optimization algorithms we got an algorithm that consistently found solutions which got us the 5th place score at the competition.
